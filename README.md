# hello-world
This is my first attempt at using Github so I am following the guide with the traditional first shot.

Programming has long been an interest for me but it has been slow going as I have been primarily focused on Writing and Acting as my main goals with painting and other art styles on the side. I have put them together on my Patreon page at www.patreon.com/StephanieValis but I like to stay active and learning so I am still working on learning programming once and for all.
